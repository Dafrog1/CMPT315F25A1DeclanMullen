        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p class="text">Hello! My name is Declan im a computer science student at macewan. For this quick mock up website ill explain a bit about myself as well as go
             into some of my specific interests. My focus is in game design not just 
             coding but also the more story based elements. Video games have been a big 
             part of my childhood growing up and are a large part of 
             my social life.

        <h1>Esports</h1>
        <p class="text">In line with my interest in video games is my keen interest in the world of Esports.
            While my primary game of choice is League of Legends I do follow alot of different 
            Esports such as Valorant, Overwatch, and some CS. 
            My enjoyment of Esports goes so far that me and a group of friends
            have watched league world finals live together the last 2 years. This
            would be a fairly reasonable thing if the game for last years finals didn't start at 1am. 
            Although it was worth it to watch T1 reclaim their crowns! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuDqVxRE4vk&ab_channel=reklatS" target="_blank">While this
                Azir play may of been from the semi finals it was my number 1 moment from worlds 2023.

        <h1>Trading Card Game(s)</h1>
        <p class="text">Outside of Video games another large part of my social
            life stems from TCG's. Magic The Gathering litterally 
            got me my first job. Whether im playing Magic or any other
            TCG im generally doing it with friends. While i used to go to
            more competative events recently I've stopped as i havnt had the time to grind.

                While i wasnt able to attend this event one of my friends actually managed to win it!

        <h1>Traditional Sports</h1>
        <p class="text">Sports arn't something that I've ever really fallen in love with. While i enjoyed playing
            Football(Soccer) as a kid that unfortunatly never stuck. Recently however, Ive gotten into
            watching Hockey with my Friends and Family.<a href="https://www.discoverhockey.com/portfolio/discover-hockey-edmonton-learn-to-play-hockey-classes/#tab-199416" target="_blank">
                Me and a Buddy are even planning to attend a learn
            to play course in the summer!
